your tracks are in the 'final tracks' folder
all my drafts are in the 'rejects'
melodies and transitions used to make final tracks are in 'betterer'

final track naming: [melodyLine_melodyLineItConnectsTo] e.g. violin_oboe means that its a violin track which transitions to the oboe track
each track is 51 seconds long, but begin playing the next track at 48 seconds, do not cut off the extra few seconds as then it sounds a bit funni
